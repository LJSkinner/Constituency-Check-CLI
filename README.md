# Constituency Check

Constituency Check is a command line utility written in Python that allows users to input a UK postcode and retrieve details about their constituencies corresponding MP's seat, the parties chances of winning, and other related information from the Electoral Calculus website. 

The data used in this project is provided by the [Electoral Calculus website](https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/newseatlookup.html), using their seat explorer tool. I am very grateful to the Electoral Calculus team for providing this website and data.
